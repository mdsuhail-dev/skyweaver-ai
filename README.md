# ✨ SkyWeaver.AI

> **What if your night sky could talk back to you?**

Transform what you see in the cosmos into profound poetic interpretations. Simple. Beautiful. Revolutionary.

## 🎯 The Idea

You look up at the stars and see something magical—a dragon made of light, your future written in constellations, an eye watching from darkness. 

**But nobody else can see what YOU see.**

SkyWeaver.AI changes that. It transforms your cosmic observations into poetic interpretations. Share your vision. Get inspired. Connect with the infinite.
